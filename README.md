# Virtual Calculator

## Overview
The Virtual Calculator is an innovative project that uses computer vision and hand tracking to simulate a calculator interface. Users can interact with the calculator by pinching their fingers to select buttons, making it a touchless and futuristic experience.

## Features
- **Hand Tracking**: Utilizes Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks and track movements.
- **Pinch Interaction**: Detects pinch gestures to select buttons.
- **Dynamic Interface**: Displays a virtual calculator interface with buttons and expressions.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid expressions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VirtualCalculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd VirtualCalculator
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python virtualcalc.py
   ```
2. Use your webcam to interact with the virtual calculator.
3. Pinch your fingers to select buttons and perform calculations.

## Customization
- Modify `virtualcalc.py` to adjust button sizes, colors, or layout.
- Update the Mediapipe confidence thresholds for better hand tracking.

## Acknowledgments
- Mediapipe for hand tracking.
- OpenCV for image processing.
